The Autonomous Anime Lab is a research lab dedicated to exploring the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to create auto-anime. This includes developing techniques for character creation, meta background generation, story and interaction generation, and multimodal generation of manga, anime, and chatbots.

One of the lab's key areas of focus is character creation, which involves creating believable and compelling characters for anime and manga. This includes exploring the use of personification techniques, such as few-shot learning and MBTI templates, to create characters with vague descriptions. The lab also aims to prevent out-of-character (OOC) behavior by confining a character's behavior and mimicking their emotions. Additionally, the lab investigates the influence of toxicity on the realism of a character and explores ways to eliminate unnecessary toxicity.

The lab also works on meta background generation, which involves creating a worldview for the anime or manga, including themes, time periods, space, world status, social and political backgrounds, and daily life. The lab aims to investigate how to picture typical themes, space, and time in the meta background generation process, and how to make the questions more interesting.

Another area of focus is story and interaction generation, where the lab aims to generate potential stories based on a set of characters and background assets. The lab explores ways to measure the degree of entertainment and ensure that the story has a clear storyline. The lab also investigates what kind of interaction is preferable in generating the story.

Finally, the lab works on multimodal generation, including the generation of manga, anime, and chatbots. For manga and anime, the lab aims to develop techniques for creating a story2manga and manga2anime pipeline. This includes techniques for animation, sound, voice generation, encoding emotions in the voice, generating sound effects, and creating auto-generated music. The lab also investigates the creation of chatbots, which can interact with users in a natural and engaging way.
